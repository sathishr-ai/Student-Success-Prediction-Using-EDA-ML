Student Success Prediction Using EDA & ML (Python)

Project Overview:
This project analyzes student performance data to extract insights and build predictive models for academic success.
It includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering and correlation analysis
- Predictive models (classification: Pass/Fail and regression: Score prediction)
- Model evaluation and recommendations for stakeholders (teachers, schools)

Files:
- `student_performance.csv` - Synthetic dataset (1200 rows)
- `student_success_analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and models
- `student_success_analysis.py` - Python script version of the notebook
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

How to run:
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the notebook: `jupyter notebook student_success_analysis.ipynb` or use Google Colab
4. Run all cells. The notebook contains explanations and visual outputs.

Notes:
- Dataset is synthetic but realistic for portfolio demonstrations.
- The project includes both classification (Pass/Fail) and regression (Score) approaches.
- Suggested next steps: hyperparameter tuning, SHAP explainability, deployment, and dashboard creation.
